            I completed my Bachelors of Science at the University of Toronto in
            Bioinformatics and Computational Biology. During my undergraduate
            degree, I worked on various projects including programming and
            designing tools for a Laboratory Information Management System,
            identifying mobile genetic elements in bacteria and building a tool
            to simplify identification, as well as exploring the non-coding
            genetic landscape of a rare pediatric brain tumour.
            <br></br>
            <br></br>In 2019, I joined the Notta Lab to start my graduate
            degree. While originally starting as a Masterâ€™s student, I
            eventually went on to reclassify as a PhD student. My project
            involves investigating the transcriptional landscape of pancreatic
            cancer with a focus on how the disease looks and changes at the
            level of a single cell. I enjoy intersecting computer science and
            biology to solve scientific problems.
            <br></br>
            <br></br>In my free time, I love learning new languages and reading
            fiction. I also find joy in caring for my balcony garden, going on
            scenic walks, playing video games with my friends, and working on
            small coding projects.
