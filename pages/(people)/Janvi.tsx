          <p>
            I was born and raised in Canada and am a fourth-year undergraduate
            student at the University of Waterloo. I am completing my Bachelor
            of Science in Honours Health Studies with a minor in Mental Health
            and a Health Research Specialization. Upon returning to school in
            the fall, I will start my undergraduate thesis in behavioural
            neuroscience under Prof Dr. John Mielkeâ€™s supervision. <br></br>
            <br></br>My previous co-op terms were highly clinical in nature, as
            I worked alongside cardiologists and periodontists. I am now
            finishing my final co-op term at the Notta Lab, where I am gaining
            the wet-lab research experience that I yearned for. Here, I assist
            with tissue cultures of patient-derived organoids, xenograft mouse
            models, tumour processing, day-to-day lab maintenance and helping to
            train fellow students. As a senior co-op, I am now working on an
            independent project examining the effects of estrogen and sex
            differences in PDAC using in-vitro and in-vivo models. I aspire to
            be a professor and translate my knowledge of cancer research to
            future students. <br></br>
            <br></br>Outside of my passion for research, I enjoy photography,
            spending time with my two dogs, concerts, and going on cottage
            trips!
