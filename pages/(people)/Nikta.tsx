            I completed my Bachelor of Science in Microbiology at the University
            of Tehran. I then attended the University of Manitoba to complete a
            Master of Science in Computational Biology. During my masterâ€™s, I
            worked on developing supervised algorithms for classifying
            cancer-specific somatic variants into pathogenic and non-pathogenic
            groups.
            <br></br>
            <br></br>After graduation, I worked as a statistical analyst mainly
            involved in feasibility assessment projects pertaining to
            pharmaceutical companies. I joined the University Health Network as
            a research analyst in 2020, where I worked on Pharmacogenomics
            projects analyzing drug response data in cancer.
            <br></br>
            <br></br>I joined the Medical Biophysics program at the University
            of Toronto in 2022. As a PhD student in the Notta lab, I have the
            opportunity to follow my passion in translational medicine and
            Pharmacogenomics analysis in pancreatic cancer.
