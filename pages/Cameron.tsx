            I am an undergraduate summer student studying Data Science at
            Wilfrid Laurier University, entering my third year. Currently I am
            working on a project to streamline data logging and improve data
            integrity at the Notta Lab. I developed a passion for computer
            science when I began to learn how to program in late high school. I
            love learning about networking security and am currently learning
            about using large language models as a tool to improve data
            analysis. When Iâ€™m not programming, I love to explore my creative
            side by making music, since I play the piano and drums. I have an
            orange domestic shorthair cat named Panko and he loves birdwatching.
